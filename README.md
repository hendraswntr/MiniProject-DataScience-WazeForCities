# MiniProject-DataScience-WazeForCities
The dataset used in this project is the crowdsourced/user generated data program Waze for Cities from Waze. There are three tables that you can use in working on a case study, namely aggregate_median_jams, aggregate_median_irregularities, and aggregate_alerts.
